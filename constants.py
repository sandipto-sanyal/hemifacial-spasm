start = """In 2017 one evening as I was sitting idly in my room in Pune which was then my workplace,
there was a sudden feeling that the left side of my face is getting pulled by some
invisible force and I cannot control it. I got to the mirror to see what happened.
I saw that my left eye was twitching.

is nothing to worry about. Thought it would go away in due course of time.

progress = """Over time the condition started to deteriorate. The eye used to twitch
constantly. Also at random times the face used to pull itself for few seconds and 
then released. There was a burning sensation in both the eyes too.

consultant should speak to his/her patients. This is for the following reasons:\n
- The patient has not visited the doctor if the problem is not troubling him/her. He is searching for a solution.
- Something that might not seem to be a problem for the consultant, might be a big problem for the patient/client.

After the consultation, it was found that I was suffering from severe dry eyes syndrome due to
my office air conditioning. Eye twitching is one of the most common symptoms for dry eyes. The doctor prescribed appropriate medicines
and ointments. He also mentioned that if the twitching doesn't go away I might have to do an MRI to rule out any presence of brain tumor.

started the diagnosis of the most common factor. He also didn't rule out extreme factors too. Though I felt that the twitching is a different as it
used to latch the left side of my face as shown below.

I went there with all the prescription from Dr. Somnath Majumdar. They treated me for severe dry eyes condition first. By their medicines, the burning sensation of eyes got reduced, but neither the
twitching nor the face latching feeling. That is where the treating doctor at LV Prasad Eye Institute explained me that this seems to be a neurological problem and not an eye problem. The eye problem
has been eradicated and no need to unnecessarily continue dry eyes medications

The doctor was an amazing person. He first explained me that I was suffering from a condition called **Hemifacial Spasm** which happens when an artery loops with the facial nerve.
Within 10 minutes I was explained the possible treatments for this disease:\n
- Use of Botox Injection - the temporary solution lasts for around 4-5 months
- Micro Vascular Decompression surgery - the permanent one where the surgen enters the affected area from behind the ear and skull and puts a teflon between the offending vessel and nerve complex.

Though I wasn't looking for temporary solutions but permanent one yet neuro surgery wasn't certainly one of them.
